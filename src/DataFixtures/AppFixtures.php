Doc, you're my only hope. There, there, now, just relax. You've been asleep for almost nine hours now. Yeah, I think it's a major embarrassment having an uncle in prison. It's about the future, isn't it?",

Hello, anybody home? Einstein, come here, boy. What's going on? Wha- aw, god. Aw, Jesus. Whoa, rock and roll. Yo",
